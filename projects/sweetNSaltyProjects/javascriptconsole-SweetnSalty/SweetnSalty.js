// Print the numbers 1 to 1000 to the console. 
// Print the numbers in groups of 20 per line with one space separating each number.  
// HINT: Use string concatenation to print the 20-number strings to the console at a time.  
// When the number is a multiple of three, print “Sweet” instead of the number on the console. 
// If the number is a multiple of five, print “Salty” (instead of the number) to the console.    
// For numbers which are multiples of three and five, print “Sweet’nSalty” to the console (instead of the number).    
// After the numbers have all been printed, print out: 
// How many "Sweet”,  
// how many "Salty”, and  
// how many "Sweet’nSalty".  
// Sweet, Salty, and Sweet’nSalty are three separate groups, so Sweet’nSalty does not increment Sweet or Salty (and vice versa).   
// Include verbose commentary in the source code to tell me what each few lines are doing.
