Sort and SortByColumns functions in Power Apps

Explantation
The formula is evaluated for each record of the table, and the results are used to sort the table. The formula must result in a number, a string, or a Boolean value; it can't result in a table or a record.

To sort first by one column and then by another, you embed a Sort formula within another. For example, you can use this formula to sort a Contacts table first by a LastName column and then by a FirstName column: Sort( Sort( Contacts, LastName ), FirstName )

The SortByColumns function can also be used to sort a table based on one or more columns.

The parameter list for SortByColumns provides the names of the columns to sort by and the sort direction per column. Sorting is performed in the order of the parameters (sorted first by the first column, then the second, and so on). Column names are specified as strings, requiring double quotes if directly included in the parameter list. For example, SortByColumns( CustomerTable, "LastName" ).

In addition to sorting ascending or descending, SortByColumns can sort based on a single column table of values. For example, you can sort record based on the name of a day of the week by supplying [ "Monday", "Tuesday", "Wednesday", "Thursday", "Friday", "Saturday", "Sunday" ] as the sort order. All records which have Monday" will come first, followed by Tuesday, and so on. Records found that do not appear in the sort table are put at the end of the list.
