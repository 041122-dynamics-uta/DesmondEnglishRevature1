The Long and the Short of It:

Hereâ€™s a great logic puzzle for kids: Six neighborhood children (Leisha, Benito, Delia, Charlotte, Weldon, and Zina) were measured yesterday.
* 		Weldon is taller than Delia but shorter than Zina.
* 		Leisha is taller than Benito but shorter than Delia and Weldon.
* 		Benito is not the shortest.
Can you put them in order of height from tallest to shortest?

# weldon is taller than Delia
Weldon -> Delia

# Zina is taller than Weldon
Zina -> Weldon -> Deila

# Leisha is taller than Benito
Leisha -> Benito 

# Benito is not the shortest, Charlotte has to be!

# Answer Order
Zina -> Weldon -> Deila -> Leisha -> Benito -> Charlotte
